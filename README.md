# The Big Picture on the “AI Turn” for Digital Health: The Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems

# Introduction
New debates have recently emerged on an “AI turn” for digital health (Kerr et al., 2018; Triantafyllidis and Tsanas, 2019). This technology horizon-scanning article offers an analysis of the ways in which biotechnology and digital health innovations are being coproduced by mainstreaming of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS) in 21st century integrative biology and life sciences.

# introduction 
Data exchange and automation using Internet of things (IoT) is a rapidly growing technology. It includes sensors, cyber systems – the things in IoT and cloud computing. To reach humans in real time, cyber systems communicate collaboratively at each stage over the Internet. The advances in Internet innovation have made possible techniques for the conveyance of healthcare. Networking infrastructure and common access can encourage sharing of patient data and clinical information making the Internet a perfect tool for remote patient observing applications . Sinnapolu et al  demonstrated integrating wearable devices with IoT and cloud to monitor health parameters and rendering assistance in case of emergency. It is an exemplary solution to the problem of communication and reporting system and attempts to address the case of an incapacitated patient driving an automobile. Similar health monitoring systems can enhance the quality of life, especially for elderly people.

# Abstract:
Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and fast growing technology in which everything ( smart objects and smart devices) are connected to
the internet for effective communication between these connected things. Internet of things serves as a catalyst for the healthcare and plays very
important role in wide range of healthcare monitoring applications. Networked sensors devices, either worn on the body or embedded in living
environments, make possible the gathering of rich information to evaluate physical and mental health condition of the patient by collecting
body temperature, blood pressure, sugar level etc. Communicating this collected information to the doctor, making accurate decision on the data
collected and notifying the patient is the challenging task in the Internet of things. In this paper author focus on review of IoT based Healthcare
System and outline about Opportunities and Challenges for Internet of Things based Patient Health Monitoring System.
