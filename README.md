## description:
### 1)-Introduction on problematic:
In normal life, people experience serious incidents, such as involuntary disappearances, abductions by wicked people, abnormal absences, etc. This raises the problem of the protection of persons!!! .
### 2)- Problematic:
How to protect a person "a child" from accidents caused by bad people ??!

### 3)- Resolution:
From this problem, I proposed a mechanism or system that controls the overall human state in abnormal situations like the case of fear! In particular a special state of fear "kidnapping" in the case viewed ''Expected' for example: normal removal without any use of intelligence ''; but in the case not viewed ''Unexpected'  for example: nasty people, are used to do well studied and less ideal. Of course with the use of intelligence! ''use other mechanism.
